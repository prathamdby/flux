# Flux

ðŸ¤– An algorithmic trading bot for cryptocurrency markets.

## Overview

Flux is a comprehensive algorithmic trading system designed to collect, analyze, and trade cryptocurrency markets using advanced high-frequency trading (HFT) metrics and machine learning models.

## Project Goals

The end goal is to build a fully autonomous algorithmic trading system that can:

Collect real-time market data from cryptocurrency exchanges, process it into meaningful features, train machine learning models to predict price movements, generate trading signals, and execute trades automatically with proper risk management.

The system will continuously learn from market patterns, adapt to changing conditions, and operate independently to generate consistent returns while managing risk through position sizing, stop losses, and portfolio diversification.

**Current Progress:** âœ… Data collection complete | âœ… ML pipeline implemented

## Current Status

**Phase 1 - Data Collection:** âœ… Complete

- Real-time BTC/USDT market data collection
- Configurable aggregation windows (default: 60s bars)
- Configurable forward return labels (default: 300s)
- All matured samples saved (filtering done in ML pipeline)
- Output: CSV format with parallel writer thread
- Quality statistics tracking for monitoring collection effectiveness
- Robust Binance depth stream synchronization with stale watchdog

**Phase 2 - ML Pipeline:** âœ… Complete

- Quantile regression models (LightGBM)
- Multi-strategy backtesting framework
- Cost-aware PnL evaluation
- Feature engineering with LOB priors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- UV package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies
uv sync
```

### Phase 1: Data Collection

```bash
# Run data collection (streams live market data)
python data_collector.py
```

**Configuration Options** (edit top of `data_collector.py`):

- `WINDOW_SEC` - Aggregation window (default: 30s for 30-second bars)
- `FORWARD_WINDOW_SEC` - Forward return horizon (default: 180s for 3-minute labels)
- `MIN_PRICE_MOVEMENT` - Minimum return for quality tracking (default: 0.001%)
- `FILTER_ZERO_MOVEMENT` - Disabled (all matured rows saved; filter in ML pipeline)

**Output:** `flux_data.csv` with HFT metrics:

- **Market Data:** Mid price, spread, bid/ask depth
- **HFT Metrics:** OFI, VPIN, microprice, tick momentum
- **Flow Metrics:** Trade volume, direction, churn, cancel rates
- **ML Targets:** Forward returns, directional labels
- **Quality Stats:** Real-time tracking of data movement percentage

### Phase 2: ML Pipeline

```bash
# Run complete ML pipeline (data prep â†’ train â†’ backtest)
python flux_ml_pipeline.py all

# Or run individual stages:
python flux_ml_pipeline.py data      # Data preparation & feature engineering
python flux_ml_pipeline.py train     # Train quantile models
python flux_ml_pipeline.py backtest  # Evaluate with multiple strategies
python flux_ml_pipeline.py cleanup   # Remove all generated files
```

**Output:**

- `data/flux_train.csv` - Training data with engineered features
- `artifacts/flux_model_q*.txt` - Trained quantile models
- `reports/flux_backtest_summary.txt` - Plain-language results
- `reports/plots/` - Strategy comparison visualizations

### Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

- Train/val/test split ratios
- LightGBM hyperparameters
- Quantile levels (default: 0.1, 0.5, 0.9)
- Trading costs (default: 5 bps)
- Strategy parameters

## ML Approach

### Quantile Regression

Flux uses **quantile regression** instead of traditional point predictions because:

1. **Captures Uncertainty:** Predicts distribution (Q10, Q50, Q90) rather than single values
2. **Risk-Aware:** Separates upside potential from downside risk
3. **Robust to Outliers:** Pinball loss is more robust than MSE in financial data
4. **Actionable:** Quantiles directly inform position sizing and entry/exit thresholds

### Feature Engineering

Based on LOB microstructure research ([Briola et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.09267v3)):

- **Order Flow Imbalance (OFI):** Multi-level weighted depth changes
- **VPIN:** Volume-synchronized informed trading probability
- **Microstructure Features:** Spread-volatility ratios, depth imbalance, trade pressure
- **Temporal Features:** Lag features and rolling statistics for pattern detection

### Backtesting Strategies

**Quantile-Based:**

- Momentum: Trade on extreme quantile predictions
- Conservative: Tight thresholds, fewer trades
- Aggressive: Wider thresholds, more trades

**Classic Baselines:**

- Bollinger Breakout: Mean reversion on band touches
- VWAP Mean Reversion: Trade deviations from volume-weighted average
- Momentum Crossover: Simple moving average crossovers

All strategies include realistic transaction costs (5 bps) and clear, non-technical reporting.

## Key Features

âœ… **Configurable Timeframes:** Adjustable aggregation windows (1s to 5min+)  
âœ… **Robust Data Collection:** Parallel CSV writer with periodic fsync, minimal data loss  
âœ… **Advanced Metrics:** Multi-level OFI, VPIN, microprice edge  
âœ… **Production-Ready:** Async architecture, stale watchdog, auto-reconnection, proper Binance sync  
âœ… **Cost-Aware:** Transaction costs baked into backtesting  
âœ… **Interpretable:** Feature importance analysis and plain-language reports  
âœ… **Multi-Strategy:** Test multiple approaches simultaneously  
âœ… **Real-time Monitoring:** Quality statistics during collection
